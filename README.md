# Quiz Time

It is just a quiz game using `HTML`, `CSS` and `TypeScript` (of course it will be complied to `JavaScript`) for the web browsers for fun. It has been implemented using the `OOPS`conecept.


## Features

- This is a general quiz game with timer functionality for each question.
- If you have completed the answer before time you can use `Next` button to go the next question.
- If you won't complete a question within time then automatically next question will be poped up and last chosen option will be considered.
- If you won't choose any option then that will be considered as NOT_ATTEMPTED question.
- At the end you will get the result of the quiz.
